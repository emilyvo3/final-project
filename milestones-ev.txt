Rubric (worked collaboratively on)

+10 Code compiles and works as intended
+8 Descriptive time log from both the partners, stating what was done on an individual level
+10 Final in-class presentation and a working demonstration of the project

My required time: More than 4 hours + 2 hours in lab. 

My task for Challenge 4: Take in user input and store them in a map.

Short report of how this challenge went: My partner and I both researched and talked about how we will create a backend server, 
utilize an interface, programming language to use, and how we would go about developing a web browser for our tutor-tutee idea 
(originally an app, but we feel like it would be difficult to manage for a 2-people group). Some parts and plans for this final project 
will still require further guidance and research before actually beginning the project.
